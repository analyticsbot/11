gaurav, we have two options for IPs

I researched but could not find a way to get 100 unique same IPs again and again. We have 2 options
1. use tor - tor is free relay service
	advantage - is free, can get unique ip
	disadvantage - is a bit slow
2. use hide my ass proxy vpn -
	advantage - is fast, can get any number of ips
	disadvantage - will cost


approach

1. i looked at how people vote on producthunt and resarched about how product hunt guys might look for fake handles.
I think the only thing that they look for is the profile score and the collusion between twitter accounts that voted. 
So for example - if a and b are friends and have vote for a product, the would consider this as a cheating. of course i'm 
talking on a bigger scale and not just 2 users

2. so what we need to create is 100 different guys with male/female mix with good pics, names, tag lines etc. manual work.

3. we would make the code in the following way
	- log onto to twitter for initial few days
	- retweet some news articles
	- particpate in trends
	- tweet about news articles
	- tweet some human stuff by copying anyone's tweet and editiing some letters
	- these twitter handles will log on daily at some unique time slots
	- what we can also do using either tor or hma proxy is request ip for a certain region such as 
		new york, delhi, munich etc so that at least the geo location is maintained. this is
		less possible with tor as it's a volunteer driven thing and this might not work out as planned
		but again this is a thought, it also might work out.
	- for the initial few days, the twitter accounts will do around 50-100 tweet action per day.
	- we can participate in trends and then tweet to some fellas some interesting line and follow them and 
		ask them to follow back
	- after initial few days, the bots would participate in product hunt votes
	- for all this we would use selenium browser which will make it more realistic
	- none of the twitter handles would follow each other to increase follower count.

let's discuss more when you are ol.
